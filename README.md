# ProductBrowserApp

‚úÖ Architectural Decisions
I used UIKit with MVP (Model‚ÄìView‚ÄìPresenter) architecture, which is a classical and well-structured approach in UIKit-based apps.
For UI, I chose UICollectionView with CompositionalLayout and DiffableDataSource ‚Äî they offer powerful, declarative layouts and performant data handling.
Given my experience and fluency with UIKit, I was able to implement and iterate faster than I would with SwiftUI.
(If using SwiftUI, I would have gone with MVVM.)
Although I intended to go with a modular architecture and extract networking and features into separate modules, due to time constraints I organized code by folders instead.
The architecture is built on protocol-oriented programming (POP) and adheres to SOLID principles where possible.
I implemented Dependency Injection without third-party libraries (though in production I typically use tools like Swinject).
Persistence and settings (favorites, dark mode) are handled via UserDefaults behind a protocol abstraction ‚Äî allowing for easy replacement (e.g., with Realm or CoreData) in the future.

‚ö†Ô∏è Assumptions & Limitations
I used UserDefaults for simplicity, since the data was lightweight, not sensitive, and didn‚Äôt require schema or querying.
In a real-world project, I would replace it with Realm or CoreData depending on complexity.
Due to time limits, I only covered the core presenter (ProductListPresenter) with unit tests.
For mocking protocols, I typically use Sourcery for auto-generation ‚Äî in this task I manually mocked minimal interfaces.
Ideally, the project would also include:
Unit tests for ApiDataSource (happy path + parsing)
Unit tests for LocalDataSource (state storing, updating)
Snapshot tests for reusable cell UI states
UI tests for full flows (toggle favorite, dark mode)
I encountered a crash with DiffableDataSource due to duplicated product items with identical identifiers (same id, title, etc.). I resolved this by filtering duplicates in the presenter ‚Äî avoiding this edge case earlier could have saved time.

‚è± Approximate Time Spent
8‚Äì10 hours total
~6‚Äì7 hours for implementation
~1‚Äì2 hours debugging DiffableDataSource issues
~1 hour writing unit tests and cleanup
